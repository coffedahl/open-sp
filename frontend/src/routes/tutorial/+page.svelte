        To use the page you go to team and go to the "Prisjusteringer" channel and then you can copy strait over all the
        new promotional prices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paste the clipboard in to the field at the top of the page. If you want to have multiple days copied in at one
        time you can just put a space between the different days.
    </p>
    <p>
        When all is pasted in to the field you can check the "Attack Clones?" box if you want the program to remove
        duplicates from the strings.
        Press the submit button and the program will fix and divide up the strings into multiple strings that are the
        correct length for the "Inventeringslista-BC".
    </p>
    <p>
        Each string has a copy button. Press it and paste the contents into the "artikelnummer" field of the report. Set
        "hyllnr" to "ib*" and press the "FÃ¸rhandsgranska" button to see all of the new
        promotional prices that have a warehouse position in IB.
        You can keep doing this untill you been trough all of the rows.
